    title: "The Driver Era",
    description: "The Driver Era are a Los Angeles-based alternative rock band composed of brothers Ross and Rocky Lynch. In 2018, the duo spun off from their former sibling-quintet band R5, in which Ross had served as lead vocalist and Rocky played lead guitar since 2009. Following their first single “Preacher Man” in 2018, the pair released their debut album X in 2019. The Driver Era’s full-length sophomore effort Girlfriend arrived in 2021, led by singles such as “A Kiss,” “OMG Plz Don't Come Around” and “Heaven Angel.” In 2022, the duo unveiled their third album, Summer Mixtape, then embarked on a supporting world tour across North America, Europe, Asia and Australasia. The band’s live show was captured on 2023’s Live at the Greek and featured prominently again on 2024’s Back To You (Brooklyn Sessions) EP. On each of The Driver Era’s first three albums, Ross and Rocky Lynch have self-produced and are credited with playing every instrument. ",
